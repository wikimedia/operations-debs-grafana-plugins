Grafana plugins Debian package
==============================

The repository contains the Debian scaffolding used to download and package a
selection of Grafana plugins.

# Build

The provided Makefile is the entry point that debian/rules will implicitely
use, specifically calling the 'build' target to download and do any necessary
preparation of the plugins. Since the internet is used, make sure your build
environment can reach out (e.g. USENETWORK=yes and/or http proxies for
pbuilder/cowbuilder), for example:

  https_proxy=http://webproxy.codfw.wmnet:8080 pdebuild

Once the 'build' target is done then the 'install' target takes care of
installing the result within the Debian package proper.
